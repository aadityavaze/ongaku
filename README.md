This is basically an Android Application which will be a great app for health & fitness.'

REQUIRED:
If your smartphone has only accelerometer then it will do the job, 
if both accelerometer and gyroscope is there its better 
if it has a step counter or step detector inbulit like in Nexus 5 
then there is nothing we need to do and if you have a wearable device 
then I don't even need to say it and if it has nothing, not an issue 
you must surely be having  GPS but then you'll surely have to outrun your battery 
and GOD FOBID if you don't have a GPS please buy a smartphone it starts at 251 Rs.
